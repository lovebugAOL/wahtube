Wyatt Geckle; Writing all VLC & video format related code, a lot of yt-dlp stuff, along with a lot of debugging (https://github.com/WGeckle80)

Me; For helping debug, writing readme.md and readmeinstructions.txt, and realizing that i typed 'true' instead of 'True' 80 times in a row in the main file (https://github.com/lovebugAOL)

ChatGPT; For setting up a base script for this code with yt-dlp stuff

# what this script actually does because i forgot to say it at first

basically, this script will download videos from youtube and save it to a directory on your pc **(THAT YOU NEED TO EDIT BEFORE USING THE SCRIPT)**, and once it's done, it'll automatically open the video in VLC **(WHICH YOU ALSO NEED TO LIST THE PATH FOR)** and yippee you have a youtube video saved to your drive

# yt-dlp

this python script utilizes the yt-dlp module (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

# VLC & ffmpeg

this python script requires the holy media player probably made by jesus himself (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

and the goofy ass video and audio merger (https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)
